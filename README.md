# Js-Restaurant

This is my 2nd JS project and my first to include JQuery(On purpose :D).

This Project's purpose was to set into action the JQuery documentation that I read through.

This project can be found on my website [here](http://joshuawootonn.com/js-restaurant/)!

This project is part of [TheOdinProject's](http://www.theodinproject.com) JS track.
The project itself can be seen [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript-and-jquery/lessons/manipulating-the-dom-with-jquery)!
